                As we enter a new age of energy potential in the form of renewables and cost have greatly decreased over the last five year (wind and solar).
                It's very qucikly becoming a practical form of energy, especially as concerns over fossil fuels continue to mount.
                One of the most critical pieces of building a business is electricity. Unfortunately, Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the lowest access to elecricity in the world.

            <p>
              One of the biggest obstacles to effectively growing an economy is
              a lack of access to affordable electricity. Unfortunately,
              Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the harshest economic and
              electrification conditions in the world, partially due to the fact
              that a traditional grid system isn't practical in most of rural
              Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA),
              since 2010 the cost of solar PV technology has decreased by over
              80% and wind power by about 50%. And as turns out, some of the
              highest natural solar and wind potential fall on some of the least
              electrified Sub-Saharan African countries.
            </p>

              As a measure of economic potential, we'll use the

                >10 critical factors</a
              ><sup>1</sup>, a more favorable ranking indicates better, simpler,
              regulations for businesses, stronger protections of property
              rights, and affordable access to electricity. Research funded by
              the World Bank shows that the economic growth impact of improving
              these regulations is strong. <br />We'll explore the impact of

                The rankings are determined by sorting the aggregate scores on 10

                The index takes the scores from 190 countries and ranks them in
                order of difficulty. A score of 1 corresponds to the easiest
                regulatory environment and a score of 190 is the most difficult.

                As mounting concerns about climate and reliance on fossil fuels
                increase, so have the necessary technological advancements that
                allow cost-efficient renewable infrustructure from solar, wind, and
                biomass sources to be possible. While we still have to make more

              <sup class="positive">*</sup> So how much is 29,955 TWh/year?
              That's the equivalent of about 2 Million KWh/year per capita.
              <br /><br />To put that in perspective, the average United States
              resident uses about 12,000 KWh/year.
