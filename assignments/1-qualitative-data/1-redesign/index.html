        <h3>Justification üëåüèª</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Content:
                <ul>
                    <li>There's a story to be told on this entire ii page that isn't being told effectively. By
                        re-imagining flow to be PROBLEM => SOLUTION => METHODS, I decided to tackle the SOLUTION
                        section, which includes the three potential renewable sources of energy.</li>
                    <li>I mainained the print graphic format ‚Äì although there's no reason this couldn't exist as a
                        digital graphic as well (as it is now). Additional interactivity would also be possible ‚Äì see
                        the link at the bottom for an early concept.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Layout:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rule of threes. Take advantage anytime you're dealing with three of something. Here we have
                        three renewable energy resources and they should all be contained in the same section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take advantage of natural vertical rhythm and stack the three sources on top of each other with
                        very thin dividers to separate each source but still appear related.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consolidate the graphics and only show 1 map of Africa that still communicates the same
                        messages. Less is more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The use of the iconography/watermarks provides a visually trigger to the type of unique energy
                        described in that section. Its opacities are reduced so it doesn't take away from the content
                        but
                        still does its job.

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Color:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        First, I decided to use a "night mode" concept that's aesthetically popular right now. There's
                        not much reason to choose light vs. dark background but conisdering my typographic alpha values
                        (explained below), many times white text on dark background is more readable with high contrast
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Used the HSB method to choose a palette. I wanted a color coordinated system to distinguish
                        between solar, wind, and biomass. Because of this, changing the hue is critical to create
                        distinct content. In order to make the feel and tone similar with different colors, all colors
                        have
                        the same Saturation and Brightness values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to the color on the icon and section content, the map of Africa suggests where that
                        energy source has the most potential by coloring the map with that same system. This method
                        helps eliminate the additional maps and allows for consolidation and comparision between the
                        energy sources.
                    </li>
                    <li>The yellow color serves as an accent color to keep pushing the "Africa" message.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Typography:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        LEFT ALIGNED!!!! One of the most egregious mistakes of the current graphic is the use of every
                        kind
                        of alignment to cause chaos instead of intended contrast all over the page. The reader has no
                        idea
                        where to look next. Always start with left aligned text and adjust if necessary. All of my copy
                        is
                        left aligned in this entire section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In order to create contrast and visual seperation between the different content, I played
                        around
                        with weight, value, font type, size, leading, and tracking. I chose Raleway for the headers
                        that
                        has a nice futuristic feel in thin weights and Open Sans for the body copy as it is highly
                        legible,
                        especially at smaller sizes. Additionally, the metrics use a Roboto Condensed font to stand out
                        but
                        still fit within the family.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All text is white except the "Africa yellow". I only adjusted the value of the text for
                        emphasis
                        and contrast - this helps by keeping the color pallete small but getting the benefit of
                        different
                        "colors" through value in text.
                    </li>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Next Steps

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If I were to take this farther, I might experiment with typography a little more, especially
                        with
                        the sections themselves. How to better show the statistics and data?
                    </li>
                    <li>Interactivity: I started playing around with what else would be possible if this graphic lived
                        on
                        the web and how users could interact with the map. See this example to show what happens when
                        hovering over a country to see its tooltip.<br><br><a href="2a - interactive redesign.png">Ineractive

            </li>
