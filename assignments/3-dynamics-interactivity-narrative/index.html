            As we enter a new age of energy potential in the form of renewables and cost have greatly decreased over the last five year (wind and solar). 
            It's very qucikly becoming a practical form of energy, especially as concerns over fossil fuels continue to mount. 
            One of the most critical pieces of building a business is electricity. Unfortunately, Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the lowest access to elecricity in the world. 
            Fortunately, Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the greatest renewable energy potential in the world in the form of solar and wind power.

          <p>One of the biggest obstacles to effectively growing an economy is a lack of access to affordable electricity. Unfortunately, Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the harshest economic and electrification conditions in the world. 
            Luckily, there's a major opportunity in the form of <span>renewable energy</span>.</p>
          <p>As mounting concerns about climate change and reliance on fossil fuels
              increase, so have the necessary technological advancements that
              allow for cost-efficient renewable infrustructure. And as turns out, some of the highest
              natural solar and wind potential fall on some of the least electrified
              Sub-Saharan African countries.</p>

              <p>While there are many issues that come with not having proper access to electricity, I will focus on the ability to conduct business. There's certainly many ways to judge a country or a region's economic performance, but here we'll use the Ease of Doing Business Index.
              Created at the World Bank, the <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/doing-business" target="_blank">ease of doing business score and
                subsequent ranking</a>  means the "regulatory environment is more
              conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm." A higher ranking (low numerical value) indicate better, usually simpler, regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights. Empirical research funded by the World Bank shows that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong.

          </div>
          <p>
           The score is made up of a composite of 10 measurements weighted equally. You can read about it in more detail in <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2019-report_web-version.pdf" target="_blank">the official report</a>.

          </p>
          <p>
            The rankings are determined by sorting the aggregate scores on 10
            topics, each consisting of several indicators, giving equal weight
            to each topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The index takes the scores from 190 countries and ranks them in
            order of difficulty. A score of 1 corresponds to the easiest
            regulatory environment and a score of 190 is the most difficult.
