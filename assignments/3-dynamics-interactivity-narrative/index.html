          </p>
          <p>
            The rankings are determined by sorting the aggregate scores on 10
            topics, each consisting of several indicators, giving equal weight
            to each topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The index takes the scores from 190 countries and ranks them in
            order of difficulty. A score of 1 corresponds to the easiest
            regulatory environment and a score of 190 is the most difficult.

          <p>
            13 Sub-Saharan African countries have less than 25% access to
            electricity. All of them also fall within the 30% hardest countries
            to do business in in the world, with an average ranking of just

              Let's take a closer look at three Sub-Saharan African countries that
              have some of the harshest business environments and least access to
              electricity:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Chad:</strong> 9% Access to Elecricity // 180 Ease of

            <p>
              How can these countries improve their ability to do business and
              their access to electricity at the same time? By taking advantage of
              their natural <span>renewable energy potential.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              As mounting concerns about climate and reliance on fossil fuels
              increase, so have the necessary technological advancements that
              allow cost-efficient renewable infrustructure from solar, wind, and
              biomass sources to be possible. While we still have to make more
              strides to make a world of only renewable energy, it's time to
              analyze our untapped potential. As turns out, some of the highest
              natural solar and wind potential fall on some of the poorest
              Sub-Saharan African countries.
